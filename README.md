# Breakaway Tickets

Currently there is no easy, safe, and efficient way to directly buy and sell Nashville Predators tickets without a middle man. All secondhand ticket selling sites have astronomical fees for both buyers and sellers these days. Breakaway tickets aims to solve that problem.

***Main Functionality:***
1. Listing tickets for sale
2. View all Ticket Listings
3. Filter Ticket Listings by Date of Game and Level
4. Message Ticket Seller from Listing
5. Edit your Ticket Listing
6. Mark your Listing as Sold
7. Delete your Listing

For fun, the app also includes the full game schedule for the remaing Nashville Predators games. It also features the current Team Roster. Finally it includes the current standings in the NHL for division and conference with a key at the bottom for those who don't know what all the symbols mean. All of those are updated in real time from the NHL API.


***Future Functionality:***
1. In the future you will be able to rate a buyer and seller based on how your interections with them on the site have gone. 
2. I would also like to make user profiles public so that you can see ratings and add another user as a friend so you may conduct business together in the future.
